In roomtags.csv:
- Add tags corresponding to sub-free, quiet, men’s only and women’s only rooms. Just put an “x” in that column if it applies. When you’re done with a tag, cross it off this list:
A. Sub-free
B. Quiet
C. Men’s only (we’ll have to wait a bit)
D. Women’s only

- Remove/add rooms that are newly unavailable/available (if any)

In roomdata.csv:
- Write a python script averager.py to add “draw numbers used”, “average draw number” and “standard deviation” columns to roomtags. I’ll start this very soon.

Misc notes:
-I couldn’t find the labels corresponding to Henrickson House or Page House West in the old data, so I renamed them HENR and PAGE respectively. Also Henrickson doesn’t have a size…?
-The unformatted data in the “rawdata” folder is pretty useless, but I think we should keep it around just in case. Plus the files aren’t very large.
