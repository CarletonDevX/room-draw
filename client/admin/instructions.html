      <strong>Send pop-up message:</strong> Type a message into the “Live message” text field. When you hit enter, the message will send to all users on the CarlDraw web page. You can specify a duration in milliseconds in brackets at the end of the message, e.g. “Hello {4000}" will display the message “Hello” for four seconds. The default is three seconds. Specifying a negative duration will make the message sticky (it won't disappear).<br><br>Note that any user who opens up CarlDraw after you have set a message will see the message for whatever duration the message was set to. There are two main reasons to hit clear: 1. Remove your last posted message so that new users opening the page won't have it pop up; 2. Remove a sticky message.<br><br><strong>Draw history:</strong> Checking a room appends it to the history. Entering a number in the “Taken by” text field will associate that draw number with the last room in the history. Unchecking a room will remove that room from the history.
