In finalroomtags.csv:
- Add tags; just put an “X” in that column if it applies. 
When you’re done with a tag, cross it off this list:
A. Men’s only (we’ll have to wait until Friday)
B. Women’s only (we’ll have to wait until Friday)
C. Should we add an off-board meal plan tag?

-Convert finalroomtags into a .json file when we’re done editing it.
-What dorms/houses are these abbreviations? WATH, FACX, STAD

-ON FRIDAY: 
http://apps.carleton.edu/student/housing/Halls_Houses/housing/roomdraw/whatsnew/
Remove/add rooms that are newly unavailable/available (if any). Rooms without sizes listed are rooms that weren’t drawn last year. If it turns out a lot of these are available now, I can do some extra work to get the sizes for them too.
-Let's save finalroomtags somewhere before we do this, because some houses may become available in later years and we'll want to use the same data.

Misc notes:
-The unformatted data in the “rawdata” folder (and roomdata.csv and roomtags.csv) is pretty useless, but I think we should keep it around just in case. Plus the files aren’t very large.
