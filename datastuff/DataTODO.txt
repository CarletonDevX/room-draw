In finalroomtags.csv:
- Add tags corresponding to sub-free, quiet, men’s only and women’s only rooms. Just put an “x” in that column if it applies. 
When you’re done with a tag, cross it off this list:
A. Sub-free
B. Quiet
C. Men’s only (we’ll have to wait a bit)
D. Women’s only

-What dorms/houses are these abbreviations? CHAN, PREN, STAD, WATH, WILM, FACX, GFRT
-I guessed that HNTH was Huntington and HUNT was Hunt, but we should double-check this.
-Find out the size of Henrickson house rooms.
-TOP PRIORITY: Remove/add rooms that are newly unavailable/available (if any). Rooms without sizes listed (starting about halfway down) are rooms that weren’t drawn last year. 
If it turns out a lot of these are available now, I can do some extra work to get the sizes for them too.

Misc notes:
-The unformatted data in the “rawdata” folder is pretty useless, but I think we should keep it around just in case. Plus the files aren’t very large.
-I might order finalroomtags at some point, but I’m leaving it how it is for now because there’s a clear line between rooms drawn last year and rooms not drawn last year.
