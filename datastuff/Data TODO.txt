In roomtags.csv:
- Rename rooms to match names in rawroomdata.csv (I’ll do this tonight)
- Add tags corresponding to sub-free, quiet, men’s only and women’s only rooms. Just put an “x” in that column if it applies. When you’re done, cross it off this list:
A. Sub-free
B. Quiet
C. Men’s only (we’ll have to wait a bit)
D. Women’s only
E. Remove rooms that are no longer available (if any)

In roomtags.csv:
- Add Fall 2013 data from roomtags.csv. (I’ll do this tonight)
- Write a python script averager.py to add “draw numbers used”, “average draw number” and “standard deviation” columns to RoomTags and fill in those columns (I’ll at least start this tonight)
